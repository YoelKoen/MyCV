            <h2>About Zombie Knock Out</h2>
            <p><strong>Zombie Knock Out</strong> is a 3D comedy roguelike where you find yourself in a bizarre boxing 
                tournament. The opponents are zombies, and they're all very proud of their fighting prowess. If you win,
                you get to leave with your brain intact. If you lose, well, they get to enjoy a delicious snack. 
                The twist is that while they are honorable in a 1-on-1 fight, they are also incredibly gullible.</p>

                <h3>How to Win a "Fair" Fight</h3>
                <p>The zombies respect the rules of a fair fight, but their pride and limited brainpower can be exploited.
                    You can buy weapons like a gun or sword and, through dialogue choices, convince the zombie referee and 
                    your opponent that it's a "legal" move. This allows you to cheat your way through each round and
                    progress deeper into the tournament.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Roguelike Progression</h3>
                <p>Each run is a new attempt to win the tournament. You'll need to figure out which weapons 
                    and dialogue options work best against different types of zombies. Since you can't be expected to get
                    it right on the first try, the game's roguelike structure allows for continuous learning
                    and adaptation with each new run.</p>

            <h3>My Next Steps</h3>
            <p>I'm currently designing the different classes of zombies from the slow and simple to the surprisingly clever to
                see how each one can be persuaded. I'm also focusing on creating the absurd dialogue trees that will justify 
                using a sword in a boxing match.</p>
