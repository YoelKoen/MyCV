        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Yoel Koen, and for the last five years, I've been diving deep into the world of code, mostly teaching myself the ropes. I've spent a lot of that time tackling projects in web development and even building a few video games. I love the challenge of turning ideas into reality.</p>

        <p>My passions are pretty simple: I love the hustle of learning new things, getting lost in a good book, and the satisfaction of problem-solving. When I'm not coding, I'm usually hanging out with friends and family or unwinding with a bit of gaming.</p>

        <p>Right now, I know my way around a bit of C#, I'm actively learning Python, and my next big goal is mastering JavaScript to build some truly interactive websites.</p>
